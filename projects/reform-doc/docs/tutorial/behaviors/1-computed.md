## Overview

Computed fields automatically calculate values based on other fields:
- `fullName` = `firstName` + `lastName`
- `totalIncome` = `salary` + `additionalIncome`
- `age` from date of birth

## computeFrom

```typescript
import { computeFrom } from 'reformer/behaviors';
```

## Examples

```typescript
// Coming soon
```
